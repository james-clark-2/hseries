Program to solve Sum(1/x, 1, N) > M for N with a given M

The algorithm could use a lot of work as far as efficiency, such as not summing the series beyond the target.

This is really more of a personal exercise in finding a way to approximate how many terms(N) are required to reach an arbitrary sum (M).
Lead to a personal discovery of the Euler-Mascheroni constant through the ratio N / e^M.
